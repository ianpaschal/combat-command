# Tournament Rankings

Although called Tournament Rankings, this part of the back-end could also be called Tournament Results.
It contains only one query, and isn't coupled to any particular table in the database.
In SQL terms, Tournament Rankings should be considered a _View_ rather than a _Table_.
